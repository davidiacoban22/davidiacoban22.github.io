    	INTRODUCTION: I am currently a student at Michael Berry and Fordson High School. I am learning a lot of new things in this class that will help me in my career. I would like to become an eletrical engineer because now-in-days everything is turning to electronic.This class has been very important inteaching us how to code.I also have a hobby which is sports. Hockey and Basketball would have be my favorite.<br><br><br><br>
        PHOTOSHOP: This was a pain of a website to use seeing as we did a lot of projects on this. Even so, most of my photoshop work is nice. Photoshop requires a lot of attention to detail. Being attentive is one of the main things that is needed for photoshop.<br><br><br><br> 
        ILLUSTRATOR: This was my favorite program to use seeing as I also got my certification in it. Illustrator is simple and easy to use. We did plenty of illustrator projects which I will be showing soon.<br><br><br><br>
        
        RHINO: Rhino is a very cool program to use. It is a fun way to see 2-D objects become 3-D. We didn't really use rhino as much this year. The only time we used it was towards the end of the year. <br><br><br><br>
        
        FLASH: I did my independent project on flash and it was good I believe. Flash was also easy to understand and to work with.<br><br><br><br>
        
        INDEPENDENT PROJECT: My independent project, as you already know, was done on flash. I chose flash because I think my animation was cool.
